# Initializing Instances

## Learning Goals

- Create a class in JavaScript using the class keyword
- Provide a JavaScript class's constructor instantiation data for an instance

## Introduction

In this lab, we are going to practice creating Object Oriented classes and instances using JavaScript's `class` keyword. We are also going to use JavaScript's class `constructor` to instantiate data into a class. In other words, we're going to create a class, and then put some data in it.

## Create a class in JavaScript using the class keyword

Remember, when we want to create a class in JavaScript, we want to create it using the `class` keyword:

```js
class Dog {}
```

## Provide a JavaScript class's `constructor` instantiation data for an instance

Within our class, JavaScript class's `constructor` allows us to pass data to our new class.

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}
```

You could then create data for the class above by doing something like the following:

```js
let bigFluffyDog1 = new Dog("Buzz", "greatPyrenees");
let bigFluffyDog2 = new Dog("Woody", "labrador");

bigFluffyDog1; // => Dog { name: 'Buzz', breed: 'greatPyrenees' }
bigFluffyDog2; // => Dog { name: 'Woody', breed: 'labrador' }
```

## Instructions

To practice OOP concepts, let's create 3 classes that use constructor methods. These constructors will assign properties based on initial parameters.

1. Create a class for `Breakfast`. `Breakfast` will have a constructor with a food and a drink.
2. Create a class for `Lunch`. `Lunch` will have a constructor with a salad, a soup, and a drink.
3. Create a class for `Dinner`. Since dinner is a little bit fancier, `Dinner` will have a constructor with salad, soup, entree, and dessert. Indicate that dessert is intended to be a private property by including an underscore (`_`) at the beginning.

## Conclusion

By effectively creating classes and instances, you have mastered the beginning of Object Oriented JavaScript. Feel free to play around with your newly created classes to create more instances!
